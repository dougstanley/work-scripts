:Description: This is the README file for my collection of scripts.

Intro
=====

This is just a collection of scripts I'm putting together that I intend
on sharing with others (mainly by linking to them from wiki articles, or
my blog). They're just scripts I've written to make my life as a sys admin
easier.

Organization
============

The scripts are organized in directories, hopefully named for their purpose.
The following is a list of the directories (which I'll update) and the purpose
for which the scripts in the folder are intended.
